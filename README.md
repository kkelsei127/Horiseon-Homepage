## Description

This weeks challenge was to take a prebuilt website and code improve it with the tools we learned the over the previous weeks. I was able to improve the code by increasing its accessibility and condensing down repetitive code. Additionally, I checked all the links and ensured they were working and in proper working order. I changed the CSS to ensure it followed the HTML Semantic styling.
